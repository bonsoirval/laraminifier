                        <p>The schools of Nursing and Midwifery gained their recognition in 1954 and 1965 respectively. In 1959, the Hospital was recognized for the per-registration training of doctors in medicine, surgery, obstetrics and gynecology.
In Mid 1970s, it got the status of a Teaching Hospital approved for Post Graduate Training of Doctors in General Medicine and Housemanship in Surgery, Internal Medicine, and Gynecology.

The Hospital, which stared with 200 beds later increased to 320 beds in 1967. It has, right from its foundation, served as a referral center next to the university Teaching Hospitals. The unfortunate Nigeria-Biafran Civil war (1967-170) retarded the growth of the Hospital. At the end of the war, the Hospital's infrastructure was destroyed. Hospital equipment were lost, and worse still, dedicated pioneer expatriate staff of the  hospital had to leave the country. Post war efforts as the revamping of the Hospital have not been succeful due to the prevailing country's economic situation.
